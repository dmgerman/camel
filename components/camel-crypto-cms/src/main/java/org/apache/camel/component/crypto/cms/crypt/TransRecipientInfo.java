comment|/**  * Information about the receiver of an encrypted message used in  * CmsEnvelopedDataEncryptor.  *<p>  * Represents the "key transport" recipient info alternative: The  * content-encryption key is encrypted with the public key of the recipient.  * This technique is compatible to PKCS#7 when creating a RecipientInfo for the  * public key of the recipient's certificate, identified by issuer and serial  * number. CMS recommends to use RSA for encrypting the content encryption key.  */
