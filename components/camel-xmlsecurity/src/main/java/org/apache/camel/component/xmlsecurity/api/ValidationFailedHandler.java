comment|/**  * Handler for handling the case when the core signature validation fails or a  * {@link XMLSignatureException} occurs during calling  * {@link XMLSignature#validate(javax.xml.crypto.dsig.XMLValidateContext)}.  *   * This handler can be used to react in a specific way on validation failures.  * For example, the handler could write logs or may even ignore certain  * validation failures.  *<p>  * Typically the handler throws an exception when a validation failure occurs.  *   * There is a certain order how the methods are called.  *<ul>  *<li>First, the method {@link #start()} is called when a core validation  * fails.  *<li>Then {@link #signatureValueValidationFailed(SignatureValue)} is called if  * the signature validation fails.  *<li>Then, for each reference in the signed info whose validation fails  * {@link #referenceValidationFailed(Reference)} is called.  *<li>Then, for each reference in the manifests whose validation fails, the  * method {@link #manifestReferenceValidationFailed(Reference)} is called.  *<li>Then, the method {@link #ignoreCoreValidationFailure()} is called where  * you can finally decide whether the processing should go on or be interrupted.  *<li>It is ensured that the method {@link #end()} is called at the end of the  * validation, even if the methods called before have thrown an exception. This  * allows you to hold state between the start and end of the validation handling  * process.  *</ul>  * If you throw an exception then the validation checking is interrupted and  * after that only the {@link #end()} method is called in a finally block. Best  * practice is to interrupt the validation at the first occurrence of a  * validation error.  */
