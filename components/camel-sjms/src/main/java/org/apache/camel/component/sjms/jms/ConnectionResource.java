A user should use this to provide access to an  * alternative pooled connection resource such as a {@link Connection} pool that  * is managed by a J2EE container.  *</p>  *<p>  * It is recommended though that for standard {@link ConnectionFactory}  * providers you use the {@link ConnectionFactoryResource) implementation that  * is provided with SJMS as it is optimized for this component.  *</p>  */
