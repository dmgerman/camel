When the implementation comes to store to the Exchange if there is already an existing      * Exchange present for this correlation key the implementation should throw an OptimisticLockingException.      *<p/>      * If the {@code oldExchange} is not null the underlying implementation should use it to compare with the existing exchange      * when doing an atomic compare-and-set/swap operation.      *<p/>      * The implementation may achieve this by storing a version identifier in the Exchange as a parameter. Set before      * returning from {@link AggregationRepository#get(org.apache.camel.CamelContext, String)}} and retrieved from the      * exchange when passed to {@link AggregationRepository#add(org.apache.camel.CamelContext, String, org.apache.camel.Exchange)}.      *<p/>      * Note: The {@link org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.MemoryAggregationRepository} is an exception to this recommendation.      * It uses the {@code oldExchange}'s Object identify to perform it's compare-and-set/swap operation, instead of a version      * parameter. This is not the recommended approach, and should be avoided.      *<p/>      * The {@link org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.AggregateProcessor} will ensure that the exchange received from      * {@link OptimisticLockingAggregationRepository#get(org.apache.camel.CamelContext, String)} is passed as {@code oldExchange},      * and that the aggregated exchange received from the {@link org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.AggregationStrategy}      * is passed as the {@code newExchange}.      *      * @param camelContext   the current CamelContext      * @param key            the correlation key      * @param oldExchange    the old exchange that is expected to exist when replacing with the new exchange      * @param newExchange    the new aggregated exchange, to replace old exchange      * @return the old exchange if any existed      * @throws OptimisticLockingException This should be thrown when the currently stored exchange differs from the supplied oldExchange.      */
