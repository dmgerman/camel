comment|/**  * Indicates that the Camel language/expression should be used as predicate.  *<p/>  * For example the EIPs which accepts expression/languages may used them as either expression or predicate.  * This annotation is used to mark situation where they should be used as predicate. As by default they  * are used as expression. And example would be the Filter EIP which uses predicate. And the transform EIP  * uses an expression.  *<br/>  * Being able to distinguish between these two situations can be of importance to tooling.  */
